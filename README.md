# GameDev
Nothing. Just the old one but cleaner.

As of now, we need to add everlasting Gravity.
Better graphics and Lighting.
Work on the Level Design.
Work on Health Bar and Pause Menu and stuff.
For now, the enemy kills upon vision like the JohnLemon one. Trying to upgrade it so that once visible, the creature follows it and attacks when extremely near, else keeps moving between waypoints.

Pause Menu not yet added. Coming in a following commit. 

GoodBye. See Ya!!!
